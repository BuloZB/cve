### Description

FlashMQ is a MQTT broker/server, designed for multi-CPU environments. Prior to version 1.23.2, any authenticated user can create sessions and have them collect QoS messages. When not sent to a client, these are then not released upon (eventual) session expiration. Version 1.23.2 fixes the issue.
