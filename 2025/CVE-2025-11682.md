### Description

Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the LMT Dashboard of the Perx Customer Engagement & Loyalty Platform allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser. The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of SVG file uploads. An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing a script payload to a campaign. When another user views this image on the public LMT microsite, the script executes, which can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other unauthorized actions.This issue affects Customer Engagement & Loyalty Platform before 4.617.4.
