### Description

VDO.Ninja is a tool that brings remote video feeds into OBS or other studio software via WebRTC. From versions 28.0 to before 28.4, a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on examples/control.html through the room parameter, which is improperly sanitized before being rendered in the DOM. The application fails to validate and encode user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed. This issue has been patched in version 28.4.
